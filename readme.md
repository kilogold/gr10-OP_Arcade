## Objective
Players must try catching coins falling from the clouds before time runs out, all while running across the edge of a cliff without falling off. Successful players will claim token amounts based on their performance. Those unfortunate to fall off the cliff will forfeit any collected coins. The coins represent a configurable amount of tokens granted to the players wallet upon winning.
